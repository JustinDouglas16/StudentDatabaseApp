# Student Database Application

# Scenario: You are a Database Administrator for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollments and balance. 

Your application should do the following:

- Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
- The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
- A student can enroll in the following courses: history 101, mathematics 101, english 101, chemistry 101 and computer science 101
-   Each course costs $600 to enroll
-   The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
-   To see the status of the student, we should see their name ID, courses enrolled, and balance
